  What is this?
content: |
  A civil case is filed because of a disagreement between two people, businesses, or organizations. The disagreement usually involves one person believing that he or she has been hurt, had rights violated, or had property damaged by another person. A civil case is not a criminal case.

  **District Court** is where general civil cases are heard if the amount of money in dispute is less than or equal to $25,000.

  **Circuit Court** is where general civil cases are heard if the amount in dispute is more than $25,000.

  **Probate Court** handles things like wills and estate administration, guardianships and conservatorships, adoptions, and registering foreign birth certificates.

  The title of a probate case is often "In the matter of…"
